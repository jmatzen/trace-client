# A client library for communicating with Ayxia Trace

## Synopsis

This implementation of the Ayxia Trace Client C/C++ API provides encapsulation of the protocol used to send trace messages to the Ayxia Trace GUI.

The C++ API provides the best performance by taking advantage of variadic templates to gather type information which can be used to format text in the viewer application instead of in the code being traced.  This can result in significant speedups.

## Log Viewer

The Ayxia Trace log viewer application is available here:

## Code Example

### C++

The C++ API uses {arg*n*} type formatting often seen in languages like C# and Java.  By default, the API can format char pointers, numbers, std::string and std::wstring.  Unicode characters should be fine and std::string is considered UTF-8 encoded. 

```C++
#include <trace/trace.h>

int main() 
{
  TRACE_ERROR("some.channel",
    "this is a test {0} {1} {2,16:4} {3:4} 0x{0:x}",
    123, "test", float(123), double(123));
}
```

### C

Using C isn't as easy. C uses printf to format the string, so all of the caveats that come with printf also apply, for example, using %s with an integer value will likely cause a fault or trying to format a floating point value with %d will give you incorrect results.

```C
TRACE_INFO("some.channel", "this is a test %d", i);

```
